# HostflowMalwareRemover
A command line tool to detect &amp; remove "hostflow" malware from infected minecraft plugins.

## Installation
Download it and drop it on your server root folder (where files like bukkit.yml are located).

## Usage

```
Start your server with HostflowMalwareRemover.jar

- java -jar HostflowMalwareRemover.jar

If you use some panel you will have to select custom server version and then select this jar.
```

All malware plugins will be moved to `plugins/malware-quarantine`.

**NOTE:** It might break some plugins that use the actual [Javassist](https://github.com/jboss-javassist/javassist) library,
if it does you should download again that plugin from official sources.
